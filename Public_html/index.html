					<p>Summer camp is a supervised program for children or teenagers conducted during the summer months in some countries. 
					Children and adolescents who attend summer camp are known as campers.The traditional view of a summer camp as a woody 
					place with hiking, canoeing, and campfires is evolving, with greater acceptance of newer summer camps that offer a wide 
					variety of specialized activities. For example, there are camps for the performing arts, music, magic, computers, 
					language learning, mathematics, children with special needs, and weight loss. In 2006, the American Camp Association 
					reported that 75 percent of camps added new programs. This is largely to counter a trend in decreasing enrollment in 
					summer camps, which some argue to have been brought about by smaller family sizes and the growth in supplemental
					educational programs.
